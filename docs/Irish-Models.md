- [pypsa-eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) ([docs](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613)) - an open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level that covers the full ENTSO-E area. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability.
