## Buildings

- [Average Residential Energy Service Demands by Jason McGuire](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jason.mc.guire#!/vizhome/BERDatabase/BEROverview) - identify optimal retrofit strategy by filtering the residential stock by fuel type and observing the stock characteristics for each fuel type.

- [BER Map](https://www.seai.ie/technologies/seai-maps/ber-map/) - gives access to building energy information on dwelling clusters within Ireland.

- [National Building Energy Retrofit Testbed (NBERT)](https://nbert-research.squarespace.com) - The National Built Energy Retrofit Test-bed (NBERT) is a 223m2 educational building that is part of the wider Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) main campus in Bishopstown, Co.
