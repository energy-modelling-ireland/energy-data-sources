# Data Wishlist

- Metered Electricity Consumption Data at as fine a spatial and temporal granularity as possible!
- Network Gas Consumption data at a Small Area level (see [Energy Consumption](#energy-consumption) for a Postcode-level demand data source)
- Pre and Post Retrofit Costs & Fabric Data

To investigate the costs and benefits of residential deep renovation in Ireland.
- Define an Irish experiment that evaluates 100+ houses in terms of renovation efficacy.
- Pre-renovation energy consumption baselines to be established based on utility bills, also record pre-renovation BER
- Record renovation intent and updates to this intent.
- Detailed logging of renovation measures, costs and timeframes.
- Post-renovation energy consumptionÂ to be established based on utility bills, also establish post-renovation BER.

For consistency to be achieved across modelling results, to create a fully representative residential synthetic stock for all of Ireland
