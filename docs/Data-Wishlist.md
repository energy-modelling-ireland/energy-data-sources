## Building Retrofitting

- Pre/Post retrofit ...

    - Capital (by measure if possible) & ongoing (utility bills before/after) costs.
    - Measures (such as type and thickness of insulation materials used, U-value, BER, heating and ventilation systems type and model).
    - Energy consumption baselines
    - Timeframes
    - Renovation intent and updates to this intent
    - **Why?** ... so that:
        1. Consistency can be achieved across modelling results
        2. To create a fully representative residential synthetic stock for all of Ireland
        3. To understand the penetration and predominant types of systems used.

- [BER Public Search](Data-Sources.md#buildings) to include ...

    - MPRN/BER number matched to CSO data
        - **Why?** ... so that there is a consistency and comparability in the data collected by SEAI and CSO regarding building typologies.

    - Actual geometry and orientation data on each BER record (or a representative sample)
        - **Why?** ... to enable dynamic simulation and validation of individual dwellings energy consumption.

    - 'Expired’ BER certificates on the same MPRN number (e.g. after the 10 year validity period or when works have been carried out and the old BER is overwritten). 
        - **Why?** ... to enable pre and post-works comparison.

    - Anonymised BER audit data
        - **Why** ... so that the percentage errors can be used to explore the confidence level that we can have in the data collected.

## Building Usage

- Residential & non-residential metered electricity consumption data at Small Area level.
    - **Why?** ... so that town/city/country scale model estimates can be validated against actual usage data.

- Residential & non-residential metered gas consumption data at Small Area level.
    - **Why?** ... so that town/city/country scale model estimates can be validated against actual usage data.

- Building Management System (BMS) and energy data from non-residential buildings in Ireland. 

- Indoor air quality (IAQ) data for residential buildings in Ireland.
