# Tools

- [archetypal](https://github.com/samuelduchesne/archetypal) - retrieve, construct, simulate, convert and analyse building simulation templates.  Includes a `tabula_api_request` function to GET TABULA data.

- [balmorel](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel) ([article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2018.01.003), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1412418)) - "a partial equilibrium model (written in GAMS) for analysing the electricity and combined heat and power sectors in an international perspective. It is highly versatile and may be applied for long range planning as well as shorter time operational analysis. Balmorel is implemented as a mainly linear programming optimisation problem." 

- [berpublicsearch](https://github.com/codema-dev/berpublicsearch) - simplifies querying the SEAI's `BER Public search` database with `dask` and `Google Colaboratory`

- [cer-smart-meter-trials-2009-2011](https://github.com/codema-dev/cer-smart-meter-trials-2009-2011) - simplifies querying the `CER Smart Meter Trials 2009-2011` datasets via `prefect`, `dask`, `pandas` and `Google Colaboratory`

- [entsoe-py](https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py) - Python client for the ENTSO-E API (european network of transmission system operators for electricity) 

- [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) - Python for street networks. Retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap. 

- [TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System)](https://github.com/etsap-TIMES/TIMES_model) ([zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4435129)) - "a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses linear-programming to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user constraints, over medium to long-term time horizons. In a nutshell, TIMES is used for, the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios."

- [TEASER](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER) - allows fast generation of archetype buildings (via `TABULA` typologies) with low input requirements and the export of individual Modelica dynamic simulation models.
